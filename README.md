## UX

### Site Purpose:
The design of an interactive little challenge that is meant to involve the user in creating the final art project. There is only one right answer though, and this will be revealed upon the right combination of switches being engaged. Upon which, a new background will load accompanied by a congratulatory message.

### Colour Scheme:

### Typography:
All fonts were obtained from the Google Fonts librabry. I chose the following three fonts for the page:
1. Rubik Moonrocks - This is the main heading font, and it resembles the universe. It felt fitting to the design.
2. Kanit - for the tagline. I wanted it to be easy to read.
3. Grape Nuts - for the labels of the toggle switches & footer text. As it looks handwritten, it fits with the feel of the doodle/drawing that can be manipulated.
4. Rubik Wet Paint - To give an eirie feel to the submit button.

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing
- The default page image, along with the favicon were loading in the gitpod preview of the site, however would not load through the link generated in github. A friend suggested that the error lay with my file paths starting with a "/", and that my image name also contained a space. Once the space & the starting "/" were removed, the issue was resolved. Thank you [Mats](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten).
- I struggled to understand how to add an event listener that would also indicate which radio button was toggled. After several hours of trying to understand what I was doing wrong, I contacted C.I. tutor support, and Ger was king enough to show me I had a an errant capital letter in my JS file.

### Validator Testing
- html files pass through the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) with no issues found.
- html files pass through the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no issues found.
- page has an excellent Accessibility rating in Lighthouse

## Credits

### Content
Support was provided by my fellow student [Mats](https://github.com/Pelikantapeten) by aiding me in bouncing off ideas & venting frustrations. They were also immeasurably helpful in explaining Media Queries in a way that I was able to grasp. They also informed me that when creating a contact form, one most also create a form-dump page.

Code for the radio buttons came from [Codepen](https://codepen.io/timtech/pen/ezRamp).

Adding an event listener for radio buttons came from [Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3Oc4IUP0XI)
