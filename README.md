Support was provided by my fellow student [Mats](https://github.com) by aiding me in bouncing off ideas & venting frustrations. They were also immeasurably helpful in explaining Media Queries in a way that I was able to grasp. They also informed me that when creating a contact form, one most also create a form-dump page.
